React Business Card from scrimba
Started learning react a few days ago and created this *masterpiece* by myself with vite and react and allat.
On the scrimba site, they were asking that I sign up for the pro thing but I didn't want to pay money for something I might not even use so I just looked this challenge up and found the requirements.


## Layout
This was my second project on my React learning journey so I was pretty overwhelmed but still confident in my google search abilities so I didn't stress too much


## Setup
Before I started this app, I had recently learned about Vite and how its used for react apps so I decided to use it for this one. I honestly don't really know what vite is used for yet other than a live preview but I'll learn. 

First thing I did was run:
```
npm create vite@latest
```
Then I chose react as my framework and ran the 3 following commands it told me to run.
