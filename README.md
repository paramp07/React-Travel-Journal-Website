# React Business Card from scrimba
Started learning react a few days ago and created this *masterpiece* by myself with vite and react and allat.
On the scrimba site, they were asking that I sign up for the pro thing but I didn't want to pay money for something I might not even use so I just looked this challenge up and found the requirements.

If you want the requirements to do this challenge yourself, here ya go!

## Layout
This was my first project on my React learning journey so I was pretty overwhelmed but still confident in my google search abilities so I didn't stress too much

The first thing I did was think of how I could slice my html code up into react components and there are many ways of doing this but I just had a "Image" component and a "Main" component. My main component then had child components including "Info", "ContactButtons", "About", "Interests", and "Footer". Now that I'm writing this, it probably would have been better if I had "Footer" as its own component but whatever its apart of the learning process lmao.

## Setup
Before I started this app, I had recently learned about Vite and how its used for react apps so I decided to use it for this one. I honestly don't really know what vite is used for yet other than a live preview but I'll learn. 

First thing I did was run:
```
npm create vite@latest
```
Then I chose react as my framework and ran the 3 following commands it told me to run.
